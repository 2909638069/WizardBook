; The processes can differ considerably in the rate at which they consume
; computational resources. One way to describe this difference is to use the
; notation of order of growth to obtain a gross measure of the resources
; required by a process as the inputs become larger.

; Let n be a parameter that measures the size of the problem, and let R(n) be
; the amount of resources the process requires for the problem of size n.
